# spring-boot-basics
Spring boot takes care of autoconfiguring services that are required such as tomcat, jpa, hibernate etc.

There are many starter dependencies that a developer can use depending on their project needs.

Most important ones are the following:
- For web services and REST API use spring-boot-starter-web.
- For JPA services use spring-boot-starter-data-jpa.
- For monitoring your webserver use spring-boot-starter-actuator and spring-data-rest-hal-explorer
